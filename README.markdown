# Sublime Text 3 plugin: Exclude Paths

Add a sidebar menu item to exclude paths from the project and / or from indexing.

Adds a "clear all excludes" command to the palette so you can undo this without having to hand-edit a project file (which you might not even have).

## Install

### Package Control

The easiest way to install this is with [Package Control](http://wbond.net/sublime\_packages/package\_control).

 * If you just went and installed Package Control, you probably need to restart Sublime Text before doing this next bit.
 * Bring up the Command Palette (Command+Shift+p on OS X, Control+Shift+p on Linux/Windows).
 * Select "Package Control: Install Package" (it'll take a few seconds)
 * Type "Exclude Paths" when the list appears to find it.

Package Control will automatically keep Exclude Paths up to date with the latest version.
